# training-implement-xmas-tree

♨️ Exercise through which you learn how to write code by passing unit tests.

## What's going on?

I've written some __unit tests__ to describe sample production code.<br/>
Your mission is to **complete the implementation** by writing a code in `src/`.

## How to complete the task?

### 1. **Clone** :busts_in_silhouette:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:piecioshka/training-implement-xmas-tree.git
```

### 2. **Install dependencies** and **start tests***:hammer:

```bash
npm install
npm run test:watch
```

### 3. **Implement** :construction:

Open the `src/xmas-tree.js` file in the editor.<br/>
Write that code which cover each of test cases.

:warning: **You must cover all unit tests** :warning:

The mission is complete when **all unit tests are passing** :tada:
